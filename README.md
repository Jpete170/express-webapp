# Express Web App

This is the backend Express.js web server that is a part of my MERN fullstack project.

## Getting Started

This application was created using the [express-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator) tool.

## API Development

I used [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to help develop the various API endpoints in this web server. The public Postman collection for the project can be found [here]().

## Web Hosting

This web server is hosted using [Heroku](https://heroku.com), and can be accessed through this [link](); although it's rather basic in terms of UI/UX Design.

## Technologies

The technologies used in this project are as follows:

1. Express.js
2. CORS
3. Express-JWT and JWKS-RSA for handling the API Route authentication
4. Helmet
5. Pug, a template engine
6. Morgan, for logging purposes.
