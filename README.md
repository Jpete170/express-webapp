# Express Web App

This is a basic Express.JS Web server that I intend to host publicly available data, which then could be used in another web application

## Getting Started

This application was created using the [express-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator) tool.

To run the app, use the command `set DEBUG=myapp:* & npm start`; or `PS> $env:DEBUG='myapp:*'; npm start` if using Windows PowerShell.
