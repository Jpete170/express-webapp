It was especially nice to sit on the little patio to eat my toast and tea and even with the NYC humming around you it is lovely to have an outdoor space.  Chas answered all my many questions with great patience and care...he really wanted us to have a wonderful time and went beyond the call of duty by even sending us links to good places to watch big soccer matches.  The apartment was clean when we arrived and had the basic things we needed such as towels and extra sheets.  While not the cheapest option on BNB it gave us all a wonderful bed to sleep in, space to spread out in when needed, and a fantastic location!  We even found street parking for the full 5 days!  Picking up the keys was a breeze and we left a few basic things for the next guests to enjoy from the corner store.   It is a gorgeous street to stay on and felt very safe. Thank you so much Chas!

Being large, the house is very quiet and no one really bother anyone else. A cleaner shows up everyday, they were two ladies when I was there. They do an amazing job keeping the place spotless, and they are also very sweet. Now, Coggee is an amazing place. The house is up the street from the beach- there is also a large green park next to the beach. It's really nice. I went swimming at the ladies bath (sometype of sea water swimming pool on the beach) the first morning despite being Winter: amazing!

The openings are sheet rocked in, so have no insulation. There is no separation from the owner's unit downstairs. What this means is that sound (all sounds, casual sounds, everything)  is completely transparent within the room. I would not recommend for a light sleeper, or for someone who needs to feel a sense of privacy. \\r\\nI also wrote up front about what I needed. I didn't feel listened to at all. Then I was blamed being for not being up front (apparently because I didn't emphasize that I seriously needed what I needed), and then was also told when I was angry that my communication style is overwhelming. It actually made me feel pretty \\\"gas lighted.\\\"\\r\\nFinally, the apartment is extremely expensive even by NYC standards. My friends who visited me during my month long stay were aghast. They felt that what I was paying for the room was close to what the rent probably was for the whole apartment.\\r\\n...On the up-side the place is clean, and the neighborhood is great.

What started as a coffee plantation in the mid-1800s is now the largest planned development on Kauai. Princeville is home to some of the finest resorts, golf courses and restaurants on the islands. Kauai’s north shore is also where you’ll find some of the most spectacular scenery in Hawaii. There are three main beaches in Princeville, which are Kenomene Beach, Kaweonui Beach and Puu Poa Beach. A wide reef along these beaches creates warm pockets for swimming and snorkeling in calm weather. Other area activities include tennis, golf, windsurfing, kayaking, fishing, sailing, helicopter tours and shopping. You can arrange for a private guided jungle hike, waterfall excursion or kayaking adventure. \",\n        \"notes\": \"The pool and hot tub are available for your use until 9 pm.

Please use rags under kitchen or bath sink to clean off Kauai red dirt (not bath or beach towels!). Do not take bath towels to the beach. AT&T phones get poor service here. WiFi available.  Queen's Bath is right across the street. It is a natural volcanic lava pool. Please observe the warning signs at the top of the path. Always keep an eye on the ocean and stay off wet rocks as that means waves have broken over them. Also the path can be slippery when wet.  The pool and hot tub are for your pleasure from 9am - 9pm.

We really wanted to see and experience Kauai the best we could. When we saw Coral's ad on Airbnb we knew it would fit all of our wants and needs. Upon arriving, we were welcomed by her husband Ian who took us around their beautiful property. Location is a huge plus with this hidden gem, it is only steps away from Queen's bath and a short 5 minute ride from Hanalei, which we frequented. The pool was beautiful, even though we only used it once. Coral does a great job in making sure her guests are comfortable. Her hospitality is in a league of it's own from offering fresh fruit she grew herself to local insights on what to do and where to go. We stayed in Princeville just before their winter months. It was mostly on the windier side, but it did not inhibit our travels. The only one  recommendation we have is if you decide to take a boat tour to the Na Pali Coast to see the open-ceiling caves, go during the summer or when the swells are below 4ft. Whale season is just starting at the end of October, so keep that in mind too if you do decide to take a boat tour. Otherwise, here are our top 5 picks picks Kauai: 1. Kalalau Trail (bring shoes with traction!), 2. Ishihara Market for Poke (see Waimea Canyon same day), 3. Lawai Beach for Snorkeling (next to The Beach House), 4. Queen's Bath (sunny and low swells), 5. Kilauea Town (bakery, juice bar, lighthouse lookout). Enjoy your stay in Kauai!

There are even cookbooks displayed in the kitchen in case you wanted to get adventurous. One of the bedrooms is in a guesthouse in the back yard and it was a nice place for the couple to sleep and be apart form the others. Be prepared for visiting bugs, though.\\n\\nBelieve Cat when she says that you won't be able to park inside the gate without a high clearance vehicle but you will be able to park in the driveway if your car is on the small side. We had a minivan that was simply too big to allow for pedestrians pushing baby strollers to get by. Parking on the street is for two hours only and the nearest long-term free parking is s few blocks away. Remember to always leave space between you and the next car as locals seem to have no issue with pinning you in if you don't. \\n\\nCat was great about communicating with us.

Loved sitting in the beautiful courtyard, sipping champagne and enjoying the fish.\\n\\nSo many small attentions to detail.... having champagne stoppers, insect repellant and a really helpful guide to the house and how to navigate the surrounding areas. Lovely toiletries and an amazing open fire - yes I had the fire going, not because it was really cold, but because I love an open fire and this was one of the reasons I chose the property.  Cat was very accommodating with this and we had plenty of firewood. The fire burnt and drew well.\\n\\nGreat location. The house is a very easy walk to Bondi Beach, even for unfit me, and an even shorter walk to groceries, bottle shop, cafe and restaurants.\\n\\nParking is the only thing that is a bit awkward.  The listing description is accurate in this regard.  If you have a regular size car you will not be able to get into the driveway, which is such a shame.

La proximité avec une station de métro est un plus ainsi que celle de l'épicerie permettant de faire les petites courses pour les repas pris au gite. Michelle est extrêmement accueillante et serviable. \\r\\nl'appartement est simple et très propres. 4 vrai lits confortables. \\r\\n==)négatifs:\\r\\nbien que situé dans un quartier + calme, la chambre donne sur la rue, et les nuits peuvent être difficiles pour les oreilles sensibles. le métro qui passe dessous est audible, tout comme les avions. mais à New York , il est difficile de trouver une endroit très calme. NEW YORK reste un environnement urbain et donc globalement bruyant, autant en avoir conscience. \\r\\nPour une famille de 4, les lits enfants sont dans la pièce qui sert de coin jour. Une table et chaises pliantes nécessitent d'être pliés  pour installer le 4ième lit et inversement, plier le lit pour prendre les repas. Pour les français que nous sommes, la table est aussi importante que le lit. ça peut être un problème. \\r\\nPeu de vaisselle ( verres en plastique) ce qui est un peu dommage mais ça reste un détail.\\r\\nMais quand on vient à New York, ce n'est pas pour une ballade gastronomique. Nous recommandons vraiment cette adresse. Très bon compromis.\\r\\nLa cours arrière sera appréciable pour les périodes + douces.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish comments:\\r\\nJust returned from NYC where we stayed with our 2 teenagers in Michelle's appartement. We are really delighted .\\r\\n\\r\\n==)positives:\\r\\nGood compromise quality / price ratio . Proximity to a metro station is a must as well as with the grocery store allowing some errands for meals at the appartement. really practical, opened until 21h. Michelle is extremely friendly and helpful.\\r\\nthe appartment is simple but  very clean with 4 real comfortable beds.\\r\\n\\r\\n==)negatives:\\r\\nAlthough located in a quiet neighborhood, the parent room is overlooking the street, and the nights can be difficult for sensitive ears. Subway is audible,as well as cars & trucks in the street. But to moderate this aspect,  in New York, it's difficult to find a quiet place because it remains a generally noisy urban environment as knowledge.\\r\\nFor a family of 4, children beds are in the main room. A table and chairs need to be folded to open beds and vice versa, folding bed for meals. it could be a problem.\\r\\nVery few dishes ( plastic glasses ) which could be improved but it's still a detail.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when we come to visit New York, it is not for gastronomic ballad, and it's important  to find a confortable & clean area. The backyard could be pleasant when the weather allows to use it. Unfortunatelly for us it's was too cold begining of march.\\r\\nWe really recommend this address.\\r\\nMany thanks to Michelle.\\r\\n\\r\\nPascale et Yann.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"_id\": \"11260293\",\n                \"date\": \"2014-03-27T04:00:00.000Z\",\n                \"listing_id\": \"1092760\",\n                \"reviewer_id\": \"11456381\",\n                \"reviewer_name\": \"Sara\",\n                \"comments\": \"Very nice apartment, comfortable beds, and felt very safe in the neighborhood.

Dertil en rigtig hyggelig gårdhave, hvor man kan slappe af efter en hektisk dag på Manhattan. Kvarteret hvor lejligheden ligger i er et beboelseskvarter, med masser af butikker, restauranter, skoler og kirker. Et levende område, men meget trygt og vi følte os meget sikre når vi gik rundt. Vi var glade for, at vi valgte at bo i Brooklyn, for der er meget at se og opleve i området. Michelles lejlighed ligger kun 30 meter fra en subway, og det er enkelt at finde til Manhattan eller andre steder på Brooklyn. Vores fly var forsinket, og vi ankom først kl. 01 til lejligheden, men Michelle var meget omtænksom og havde lagt vand og juice i køleskabet, og sørget for at der var kaffe. Så kunne vi lige klare os til næste morgen, hvor vi handlede ind i supermarkedet - tak for det Michelle.\\r\\n\\r\\nI det hele taget gjorde Michelle det nemt at være turist i New York. Hun var tilgængelig for vores spørgsmål og da vi skulle hjem, bestilte hun en taxa til os.

There are plenty of delis, but those usually don't have a wide array of products, especially when you prefer to eat healthy. So you'll basically have to be in Manhattan for the higher end supermarkets, and those tend to be very pricey, and you're more or less scr*wed if you're a vegetarian/vegan.

I grew up in the  the Mid-West and saw the beauty of living in California.  I was born in Venezuela and have always worked on both English and Spanish, and am able to teach both languages.  My dream was to have a home in Hawaii.  I've have spent the last few years traveling  between CA  and many of the Hawaiian Islands in search of the perfect home.  We are settling on the shores of this quaint village.  I am married with one 15 year old son, and one dog Max. I love to hike and the kings trail is close to this house. I love nature and there are wild goats over on Umi street. I love to watch movies and there is netflix at the house. I love geckos and there are brown and green ones at the house. I like deals and the Aloha Beach house is one! There is a king bed now in the master- everytime we go we make the house nicer! It's nicer than our house in California. The master bedroom downstairs is very large and has a queen bed and futon. House can accomodate large groups; I just have to charge extra due to utilities. We get lots of family groups!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis beach house has been a 30 year dream in the making!  It is always so incredible when you see your dreams come true with belief and hard work. Please come and share the  Fantastic Sunsets at  Makai Hideaway- The sunsets are phenomenal and the snorkeling / swimming hole is a two minute walk from the house. The beach is a 15 minute hike from the community center in Milolii. I just enjoyed Easter services with the local people and it was wonderful at the little yellow church in the village. It really is a special place set  near  the last hawaiian fishing village\\r\\n\",\n            \"host_response_time\": \"within an hour\",\n            \"host_thumbnail_url\": \"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/6017048/profile_pic/1387948340/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small\",\n            \"host_picture_url\": \"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/6017048/profile_pic/1387948340/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium\",\n            \"host_neighbourhood\": \"Island of Hawaiʻi\",\n            \"host_response_rate\": 100,\n            \"host_is_superhost\": true,\n            \"host_has_profile_pic\": true,\n            \"host_identity_verified\": true,\n            \"host_listings_count\": 2,\n            \"host_total_listings_count\": 2,\n            \"host_verifications\": [\n                \"email\",\n                \"phone\",\n                \"reviews\",\n                \"kba\",\n                \"work_email\"\n            ]\n        },\n        \"address\": {\n            \"street\": \"Captain Cook, HI, United States\",\n            \"suburb\": \"Island of Hawaiʻi\",\n            \"government_area\": \"South Kona\",\n            \"market\": \"The Big Island\",\n            \"country\": \"United States\",\n            \"country_code\": \"US\",\n            \"location\": {\n                \"type\": \"Point\",\n                \"coordinates\": [\n                    -155.89926,\n                    19.20636\n                ],\n                \"is_location_exact\": true\n            }\n        },\n        \"availability\": {\n            \"availability_30\": 5,\n            \"availability_60\": 21,\n            \"availability_90\": 40,\n            \"availability_365\": 215\n        },\n        \"review_scores\": {\n            \"review_scores_accuracy\": 10,\n            \"review_scores_cleanliness\": 10,\n            \"review_scores_checkin\": 10,\n            \"review_scores_communication\": 10,\n            \"review_scores_location\": 9,\n            \"review_scores_value\": 10,\n            \"review_scores_rating\": 97\n        },\n        \"reviews\": [\n            {\n                \"_id\": \"8239390\",\n                \"date\": \"2013-10-21T04:00:00.000Z\",\n                \"listing_id\": \"1095174\",\n                \"reviewer_id\": \"5868092\",\n                \"reviewer_name\": \"Yury\",\n                \"comments\": \"Our stay at Aloha Beach House was very nice.

We felt incredibly privileged that she shares her wonderful home. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, the location: One of the things that the Big Island is known for is its volcanoes and lava. Other than seeing actual flowing lava (which wasn't possible during our stay), one can pretty much experience the same at the seaside house. The house is on actual lava flow and one can see and experience the lava field the community is built upon. In addition, one can see and hear the ocean and the beautiful coastline from the house. There is a small black sand beach less than 20 minutes away as well as another swimming/snorkeling location less than 5 minutes (walking!) away. In short, the location is beautiful!\\r\\n\\r\\nHospitality: It is the little things that count: an up-to-date 2014 travel guide for the Big Island that we brought with us on our daily excursions, Hawaiian music CDs, DVDs, wifi, kitchen utensils, bowls and everything else you'd need to cook, laundry room, game room, water fun activity stuff...we really couldn't have asked for anything more during our stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe process: Cheryl was very responsive to our request to book, even though we contacted her last minute. She is very friendly and answered all of our questions promptly. Her directions were excellent, we had no problem finding the house at night. Daniel the local caretaker is a fount of local information, providing tips on what is worth the time and money and what is just a tourist trap. \\r\\n\\r\\nOther miscellaneous thoughts: the house is a ways away from the main tourist area of Kona, which is great because you can enjoy your stay away from tourists. Also, the house is great value to share with some friends as there are plenty of sleeping places. \\r\\n\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"_id\": \"26175667\",\n                \"date\": \"2015-02-06T05:00:00.000Z\",\n                \"listing_id\": \"1095174\",\n                \"reviewer_id\": \"21506963\",\n                \"reviewer_name\": \"Nicholas\",\n                \"comments\": \"We loved the house!

The twisty roads take some getting used to, especially for a Canadian who's used to wide open spaces and straight roads.

Although we didn't have the opportunity to use the kayaks or the snorkel gear because the waves were very rough near the house - I think this is uncommon and was due to a swell passing through.

Captain Cook is not too far, but the traffic took us nearly an hour. Make sure to bring your own food to the house.

Gave all the pertenant information and giving us some local insite in where to go was an added bonus. By having Cheryl check in a few times before the scheduled arrival it made me feel like she was there and not just a hotel that you check in/out and thats it. Cheryl you made it a very personal experience and that is nice. Thank you.  I think the only description that I either missed or was not there was just the windy roads to mile marker 89 and the 3 miles down to the subdivision. I am very glad we arrived in daylight as the road could have been a  little scary in the dark first time round. Some people may not enjoy those trips daily up/down that road. Might be nice as a heads up for potential guests. Just a thought. The sunsets views as well as the sunrises were incredible. That was spot on. The neighborhood was very quiet and felt really safe there (when we were there). I think the place was fantastic. I sure hope that the new houses going up don't affect the view but really unless it is a high rise the views will still be spectacular. Location was great. Close to Volcano, South Point and  getting to Hilo. It was also great heading back into Kona. Windy roads definitely slow travel down but gets you to look at all the local land. We did not even have to spend money on snorkeling trips as we had enough gear and enough beaches to go do it ourselves. Tons of dolphins within feet of us. Turtles. Many fishes and we believe one small shark! I mean the beauty was everywhere. Just know that the beaches nearby are not your typical sandy white beaches but beautiful in their own special ways. Make a point to eat local kine foods. Markets, fruit/vege stands all over. Fresh fish. Cook at the house....We had a few of our best meals at home and local grown foods. No paid for luau needed. I got to eat poi daily. ONOLICIOUS! Mahalo nui Cheryl for a beautiful comfortable home and the most perfect lanai.

The others in our party were fine (only a couple of mosquito bites here and there).

It was very hard to cool off the room, especially at night since the fans will only run if the lights are on. \\nWe did have a great stay, a few tweaks could make this place even better. \"\n            },\n            {\n                \"_id\": \"104984644\",\n                \"date\": \"2016-09-29T04:00:00.000Z\",\n                \"listing_id\": \"1095174\",\n                \"reviewer_id\": \"43382040\",\n                \"reviewer_name\": \"Lea\",\n                \"comments\": \"Cheryl provides everything to have a great time, from the kayaks to the snorkeling gear and the pool table!\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"_id\": \"121279458\",\n                \"date\": \"2016-12-15T05:00:00.000Z\",\n                \"listing_id\": \"1095174\",\n                \"reviewer_id\": \"14455379\",\n                \"reviewer_name\": \"Najia\",\n                \"comments\": \"Cheryl's house was absolutely incredible!

We love the South Kona area, warm days, cool nights, ocean breeze, stars fill the night sky, watch wales from the deck, waves splashing on the lava, very few bugs and the ones that were there got zapped by the largest bug zapper we have every seen. And best sunsets ever, first night we saw the Green Splash! Walk or hike the area and Daniel will tell you how to get to a very private black sand beach and some other places to visit, such as Hookena  Beach Park, only a short drive. Wish we had gone there our first day, as we waited our last day to visit this beach and still got to swim with the Dolphins. WOW! If you decide to go to this beach, go early as the parking fills up fast.  So spend some time talking with Daniel, you will be glad you did and he is a great guy and our new friend. We spent two weeks at Cheryl's home and could have spent two more. Everything you need and more is at this house. Next time we are going to make it three weeks. Mahalo Cheryl.

We couldn’t have made a better choice. Cheryl has a beautiful house in a great location. We were 7 adults celebrating my daughter’s college graduation and our 32nd anniversary in May 2018. After we planned the trip, Kilaueua erupted and that made us even more excited to visit. Unfortunately, it also meant vog on our side of the island, eliminating the Fantastic Sunsets part of the equation. But it also meant less direct sun, so much cooler. Cheryl’s house is ideal if you want to get away from the madding crowd, but have access to all the Big Island has to offer. We were out of the house every day by 7am and back in time to make dinner and enjoy each other’s company. Our itinerary included Honomalino Beach, South Point, Discovery Harbor, Green Sand Beach, Punalu'u Black Sand Beach, Hilo, Rainbow Falls, Mauna Kea, Makalawena Beach, Kahalu’u Beach Park, Kealakekua Bay (visit Ehu & Kai Adventures for rentals – family-owned!), Captain Cook monument, and the City of Refuge - Pu'uhonua O Hōnaunau National Historical Park. All with Miloli’I as our home base. It IS 10 minutes off the hwy down a winding road with a 1500-foot drop in elevation, but that’s a good thing to me! There was nothing we needed that wasn’t already in the house, except food, but including spices. The property description is excellent; the house is exactly as described. One thing that I didn’t pick up on is that the water cistern isn’t for drinking water – Cheryl provides that in a couple of water cooler/dispensers with plenty of extra jugs of water. But water became our only problem – more below. Thought we would use the ping pong & pool tables, but no time – we were never in the house. Never turned the TVs on either. The house did get hot after being locked up all day, but it cooled off fast with so many windows and screen doors and fans. Costco IS a sensible first stop before coming to the house. We planned out our meals and got most all the ingredients there. We ended up with too much food though, and took most of the excess over to Pahoa to donate to the Leilani Estates evacuation center. Funny though; we didn’t seem to have an excess of alcohol.  But as with most marvelous properties, everything’s great as long as everything’s great. But what happens when something happens? I think that’s when you find out what kind of host you have. For us, it came on the 7th day- no water came out of the faucets. We let Cheryl & Daniel know, and they immediately went to work trying to find the problem. It turned out we were out of water, which was a little odd since we were fairly conservative on water use and the house has a big tank.

We stayed there for two days for an event down at Milolii. The whole house was already opened for us upon arrival and I had to sign a form that Daniel brought personally to the home. There were no sponges to wash dishes but was addressed by owner quickly and the manager Daniel brought them by. Upon arrival the house was extremely hot, like an oven with only 2 fans for the 14 people upstairs and downstairs. By the next morning the house cooled down much and was fine for the rest of our stay. Would recommend adding fans for every room in the future. The water was not drinkable due to the machines spitting out white particles even when we changed bottles so we were lucky we brought our own as this house is on catchment. The house was nicely decorated and very beautiful and mostly clean. It had EVERYTHING we needed from paper plates to fresh coffee and creamer and lots of dishes, dishwasher, towels etc which was a great touch. There was even a cute disco ball, pool table in the living room.  Daniel was kind of strange but didn’t bother us besides check in and we were thankful to Cheryl for her accommodating such a large group and think she really puts thought and time into her airBnB even though she is in the mainland. There is a cliff-ocean view and beautiful starry skies but the beach is a small drive away.

This made my 6th trip to Hawaii (first to Kona) and it was simply wonderful.

É compartilhado com mais dois quartos (que quando fui estavam ocupados) mas não tivemos problemas. Sempre limpo nos dias que estive aqui. \\nCozinha: Bem equipada e pode ser usada sempre que necessário. \\nAnfitriã: Natasa foi uma excelente anfitriã!

I stayed here for 44 nights and she cleaned maybe one time before we arrived there. And the host got 50EUR for cleaning fee. In Barcelona, average fee for one-hour-full-cleaning is 10EUR. That means, with that money, actually I could call the cleaning lady for 5 hours. And was it clean? Not at all. She just pretend she cleaned (or maybe just organized a bit) but actually every corner I could find dust everywhere. And AMAZINGLY, she asked us 7EUR for each person for linen service. She said it includes sheets, pillow cover, table sheet, and serviettes. What kind of tourists is bringing their own sheets and table covers?? Don't you think of course it has to be included on the huge money I already paid? More than 1700Euros for 44nights? I think it is ridiculous and she knows that we are tourists and we don't know how it is going on exactly and tried to steal our money with any ways she can try. When we were looking for the flats, there were barely left the places and we didn't have choices and we were desperate so paid 14EUR for that. (One more thing here, this place was left until the last moment . Hope you know what it means) But there was even no serviettes and only blanket and pillow cover. And the facility. INCREDIBLY old and it looks that she doesn't live there so she doesn't care at all. The washing machine never closes the door maybe you need to try 1000 times. And I sent her a message for help and her answer was 'try gently again'. If she got money then she needs to serve proper services with that money. The facility is not only old but also not working. The host only thinks about money without helps for the money. This is the chat about paying the rest money when I did not know the cash paying is not allowed. Finally we asked Airbnb to explain her about the money.\\nLast but not least, The house has Wifi.\\nBut, most of time it doesn't work. And only one small tiny place works very seldomly.

Even when his oven stopped working - which was a big deal for us - he told us in advance and managed to secure an alternative, which we finally decided not to use (hope that's ok Jon). My only comment that I think could improve anyone's stay in the future is a mini map of the house pointing to where the basics are, what to use and what not to. It is almost self intuitive, but for someone that was using the service for the first time, I had lots of questions at the very beginning.

First, Jon's house is in an excellent location- there is plenty to do within walking distance (grocery stores, restaurants, and even the Barclay's center), plus the connection to public transport is outstanding- there are a few stops within a 5-10min walk, leaving you with tons of local / express train options. We traveled to Manhattan every day and never spent more than 30min on the train. Additionally, the house is huge and never felt small with six of us there. The kitchen is big enouch to cook a modest meal, and the dining / living rooms are perfect places for larger groups to reconnect after a day of activities. There's also two full bathrooms, so just a tiny bit of planning prevents any bathroom scheduling conflics.\\n\\nThe main thing that keeps this from being a perfect rental is the sleeping arrangements- there is really only one real bed suitable for two people. There's a second queen bed in the listing that can accommodate two people, but it's only a sofa-bed in the 2nd floor study (separated from the main bedroom by a curtain). The 3rd and 4th bedrooms on the 3rd floor have twin beds which, though more comfortable than the sofa-bed, will always feel like two separate beds even when pushed together. Families or groups with people desiring individual beds will be fine here (the top two bedrooms would be perfect for a few kids or friends bunking together to save money), but you if your party has more than one couple, you might consider other options.\\n\\nAll things considered, this property is a pretty good value- it's a huge place that can accommodate many people, and it's in a perfect location. However, if I were to return for a similar trip, I'd only consider a return visit if at least one more queen+ bed was added.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"_id\": \"219485148\",\n                \"date\": \"2017-12-17T05:00:00.000Z\",\n                \"listing_id\": \"1155475\",\n                \"reviewer_id\": \"15667184\",\n                \"reviewer_name\": \"Jeffron\",\n                \"comments\": \"Impeccable home in a great location, really accessible to all areas of Manhattan and Long Island.

Fort Greene is a also a great neighborhood itself with lots of shopping options, the park and the BAM. The house itself is very nice, arranged over three floors with a large yard on a quite street. Check in was completely painless and Jon was super responsive when we had an issue with internet.\\nOverall it's a great house and a unique experience to pretend to live in such a coveted neighborhood. However, I ended up paying about 800 per nigh because it was the holiday season and I am going to write a review based on this price. \\nThere are a few things that COULD BE IMPROVED though. First, I somehow convinced that this would be a house in which Jon lives but this is not his primary residence. As a result, the house feels like a rental with older furniture and rather empty (plates and most cups are made of plastic for example, and I doubt anyone would live like that). \\nApart from salt and a few spices, it was hard to find something to cook with so we had to buy pretty much everything to make French Toasts in the morning for the kids. It would have even nice to find sugar or syrup for example. Other than that, the kitchen is rather well equipped with pans and a nice gas range.\\nFinally, my main sore point is about comfort. Were were two adult couples and two young kids. Kids slept very well and had basically all of the third floor for themselves, including a private bath with a tub. This was great!! The master bedroom was spacious and quiet and the bed was ok. However, the second bedroom was not so comfortable and rather small. Two nights were probably the most we could take in it. The bathroom is great though: excellent water pressure, hot water for everyone.\\nAlso, as we were about to check in, Jon let us know that the washer was broken. This was of course not a problem but I believe that it had prevented the cleaning person to wash the linens, which smelled like someone else had slept in them. The towels also smelled moldy. It's pretty clear that all were thrown in the dryer without a wash and I would have preferred if we were told about this.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"_id\": \"225798768\",\n                \"date\": \"2018-01-07T05:00:00.000Z\",\n                \"listing_id\": \"1155475\",\n                \"reviewer_id\": \"41338016\",\n                \"reviewer_name\": \"Guannan\",\n                \"comments\": \"Jon is an outstanding host.

Jon provides a pack and play porta cot and even went out and purchased a stroller for us to use during our stay so we had a spare one for our 3 year old who wouldn’t cope with all the walking in NY.

While there were a couple of quirks, they weren't substantial in any way and the price was more than 50% less than nearby hotels.  The lighting in the place is stunning and the building tends to be very quiet.  Getting the keys was not a problem.  We had a bit of trouble getting in to the building a couple of times, but that was resolved with the help of a friendly neighbor who was our designated contact since the host is away.  The door to the apartment was a difficult to unlock as well, but that may have been my error.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I would very highly recommend staying at Willy's place.

But it is the perfect setup and the PERFECT location if you want to be in the heart of Brooklyn Heights. There is a desk in the bedroom and an Internet connection (not perfect, but mostly worked) so I was able to get some work done too.  Willy was delightful to interact with - accommodating and prompt. After exchanging mobile numbers, we were able to text back and forth, which is very efficient. The bathroom sink turned out to be completely clogged but Willy got a plumber to fix it the next day.

Die Sauberkeit allgemein lässt zu wünschen übrig. Die Küche war schmuddelig, die Frottétücher zwar gewaschen aber stinkig. Vorhänge und Sofaüberwurf haben ebenfalls schlecht gerochen. Überall viel Staub unter den Betten, in den Ecken und unter dem Fernsehmöbel, hier wurde, wenn überhaupt, nur sehr oberflächlich gereinigt! Auf den Fotos im Inserat wird geflunkert. Die Fenster im Zimmer mit einem Bett, der Küche, dem Bad und dem Entree gehen in das Treppenhaus, es gibt also kein Tageslicht und keine Luft.
